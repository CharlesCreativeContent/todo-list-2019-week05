## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

My learning was focused on creative ways to use a toggle in an application.

## Optimizations

Would have liked to optimally cache the list, so it saves each session. Even though I personally liked my use of the string methods to change the class of my paragrapgs, in the midst of the project learned some DOM methods that would have made my code much more efficient.

## Lessons Learned:

Finally got the toggle to work how I expected. I used string methods to circumvent a problem I was having with a certain Dom Method.
